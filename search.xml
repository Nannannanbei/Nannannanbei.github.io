        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>ERP system is actually the company’s operating system. Without it, the company could not operate at all. If the ERP system is hit, the consequences will be devastating. With more and more attacks on ERP system, it is urgent to protect ERP system. One reason why companies do not protect their ERP systems as thoroughly as they should is that the scale and complexity of tasks are overwhelming. There are well-established practices to secure systems from cyberattacks. But the scale and complexity of ERP systems mean that companies may need to adjust their cyber recipes. While there is no such thing as a perfectly protected environment, there are seven activities that companies should consider to better detect, defend against, and recover from cyberattacks<br>1.Identify your most important information<br>Enterprises should know what and where their most important information and systems are, and the consequences of these systems being attacked, such as customer data.<br>2. Create a road map to identify all interfaces with the system<br>Identify the interfaces in the system and create maps. The complexity of the ERP system means that the evaluation will be time-consuming. In this way, it can gradually build a complete map of point-to-point connection between the ERP system and other parts of the it field, and be used for process optimization and network security.<br>3. Install middleware to monitor data flows<br>By collecting and organizing system interfaces in one place, the middleware layer makes them easier to monitor and quickly shut off when an interface is under attack. Rerouting each interface connection to the middleware can be arduous, but it’s crucial.<br>4. Reduce vulnerabilities and data flows where possible<br>In some cases, it may make the most sense to “cut off” the data flowing through certain 3Seven steps to help protect your ERP system against cyberattacks, This essentially reduces the number of vectors that can introduce an attack. Phasing out legacy technologies could allow the company to make quick progress in shutting down vulnerabilities and building momentum.<br>5. Stop backing up ‘hacked’ systems<br>First, companies should consider running backups daily or weekly. his could increase the chance to spot an attack and keep it from being backed up. When the system is certified as clean, it can be safely backed up. Similarly, there is software available now to monitor backup systems as well for any unusual backup activity, often a sign of an attack.<br>6. Make ERP teams an integral part of cyberattack-response exercises<br>ERP teams could help to make sure that response exercises test ERP systems’ end-to-end processes rather than isolated databases or parts of the systems; that they are based on an understanding of the potential effects of an attack on the business and the processes that are in place to respond.<br>7. Be more systematic in hardening ERP systems A number of best practices have been established to improve cybersecurity that can be applied to an ERP system.<br>One of them is restricting access to the ERP system to users with multifactor authentication (MFA) and through virtual private networks (VPNs); another is conducting regular vulnerability scans and pen tests to measure how long it takes to spot and respond to attacks.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The space economy has made remarkable progress in modern times, and has made many achievements, gradually changing the world. Originally, space activities only belong to government departments, but with the progress of technology and the reduction of costs, as well as the development of the manufacturing field, the private sector has also gained access to space. For example, SpaceX, Blue Origin, etc. At the same time, due to the sharp increase of funds, the space economy has also developed rapidly.<br>Innovation in space has great potential, and different fields can achieve new goals in space. For example, pharmaceutical companies and semiconductor companies have used the characteristics of space to improve their products and make new inventions. This seemed unthinkable before. The first space exploration companies will have the first mover advantage. Since 1957, the space economy has achieved communication and data analysis through satellite services, assisting companies and governments to complete multiple tasks. In addition, it also provides people with network connection and online navigation. Satellites help leaders solve difficult social, economic and environmental problems, such as climate change, environmental change, food security, national security, etc.<br>Researchers and space enthusiasts have been talking about the commercial potential of space. With the progress of technology and the reduction of cost, the development of space economy has become hopeful. People can gradually realize large-scale space activities and apply them to all aspects of society,. In addition, with the continuous reduction of costs, more and more companies will consider space projects. They may even benefit from space exploration for the first time.<br>Although there are still many uncertainties, analysts are very happy about space. With the reduction of cost, the progress of technology, the development of new applications, etc., the space economy will become a big industry, creating huge economic value. If this is to become a reality, there is still much to be done, including further reducing costs and encouraging companies to increase investment in the space economy. The use cases of space economy can be divided into two categories, one for the Earth and the other for space orbit activities.</p>]]></content>

Virtual reality, augmented reality and other advanced Internet and semiconductor technologies have improved people’s online business experience. The metaverse is the fusion of various technologies today, and has different meanings for different people. Metaverse has realized the platform and equipment of seamless cooperation through technology, and provided the possibility for people to interact. Now, the metaverse is used in games, but it can be applied in many aspects. The real meaning of the metaverse is to provide a community environment for people. You can play a role in the community and belong to the community, not just a user. With the development of the times, it seems that the metaverse has become a necessity and has an impact on the economy<br>At its most basic, the metaverse will have three features :a sense of immersion，real-time interactivity，user agency. And ultimately, the full vision of the metaverse will include the following: platforms and devices that work seamlessly with each other ,the possibility for thousands of people to interact simultaneously ,use cases well beyond gaming.<br>Today’s metaverse consists of ten layers , which fall into four categories: content and<br>experiences, platforms, infrastructure and hardware, and enablers. Technological progress lays the foundation for the future metaverse experience (other example like blockchain), such as 5G and other technologies. Computing infrastructure, network infrastructure and interface hardware still need to be improved to achieve the development of the future metaverse.<br>    The metaverse is not just a fashion, this change has taken place in our lives. Many people associate games with the metaverse. But the metaverse goes beyond games. In the future, any activity can be simulated or executed in the metaverse. For example, business, economy, life, medical care, and everything you can imagine, with AR and VR technology.<br>There are also risks in the metaverse and business leaders should prepare for the metaverse. impersonation, attempts to steal credentials, social engineering, nation-state espionage, inevitable vulnerabilities…… So we must keep some concerns in mind! Not participating in the metaverse will lead to competitive disadvantage. The metaverse has great potential in solving social problems. It can solve a series of social problems and create new possibilities, so we must pay attention to it. Many experts have put forward suggestions on this, and we should also understand and accept it and think about its significance.</p>]]></content>
